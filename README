This is Base4R, a Ruby client library for the Google Base API.

All code is copyright 2007-2008 Dan Dukeson.

This code is licenced under the GNU General Public License, which can be found in the LICENCE file.

This release is quite basic and doesn't attempt to cover the whole of the Google Base API. In particular the code is write-only, i.e. there is functionality to create, update and delete Base items but nothing to query the Base API. Contributions of code to add this functionality would be welcomed.

You can contact the author at dandukeson at gmail dot com, or raise feature requests through the project page hosted at http://code.google.com/p/base4r/issues/list

To run the unit tests you should make a file test/test_config.rb with content like the following, but replacing the example values with your Google Base login details and API key.

TEST_CONFIG = {
  :username => 'user@example.com',
  :password => 'password',
  :api_key  => 'example_api_key'
}
